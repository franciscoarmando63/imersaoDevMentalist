### In this third class of Dev Immersion, we will create a guessing game, where the program chooses a random number and we will try to get it right

<br
/>

<strong>
  CHALLENGES OF THE CLASS
</strong>

<br
/>

* Modify the mentalist's scenario and components of alternatives, points and etc.

* The break statement can be replaced so that the code exits while while without it. Can you think of an alternative?

* Change math.random () to work with other intervals between numbers.
